# Modeling Diabetes Progression using ANN

## Objective
To model the progression of diabetes using independent variables from the sklearn
Diabetes dataset using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

## Dataset
The Diabetes dataset is sourced from the sklearn library.

## Methodology
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature normalization using StandardScaler
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ANN model development and training
- Model evaluation using MSE and R2 Score
- Model improvement through architectural tuning

## Models Used
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R2 Score

## Conclusion
The ANN model successfully captures the relationship between medical features and
diabetes progression. Model improvements resulted in better predictive performance.
